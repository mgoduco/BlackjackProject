# BlackJackProject
### Description
This project is a console version of blackjack. It incorporates all of the basic rules of the card game blackjack except for a few (soft aces, double down, splitting hands). The app allows you to start a game of blackjack with a standard deck playing against a dealer, the player is dealt their initial cards and chooses to hit or stay. If the player has blackjack they win automatically, and same goes for the dealer if tied it is a push. After winning or losing the player is prompted to play again or quit.


### Technologies Used
- Git and Github
- Eclipse
- UNIX Terminal
- Enumerated Types
- Object-Oriented Programming

### Lessons Learned
This project was excellent practice on object oriented programming as all parts of it were taken into account. Inheritance was important as the deck and card classes could all be reused for another card game potentially. Class visibility was important in this code as well as protected modifier was used in certain classes. This project also demonstrated the value enums can have specifically in the rank and suit classes.
